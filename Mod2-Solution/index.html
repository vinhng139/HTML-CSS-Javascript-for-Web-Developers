                <p>
                    Genshin Impact is an open world action role-playing game that allows the player to control one of four interchangeable characters in a party.
                    Switching between characters can be done quickly and during combat to the player to use several different combinations of skills and attacks.
                    Characters may have their strengths enhanced in various ways, such as increasing a character's level and improving artifacts and the weapons that the character equips.
                    In addition to exploration, the player can attempt various challenges for rewards. Scattered across Teyvat are highly powerful challenges that reward highly valuable resources,
                    but claiming them uses up a currency called resin, which slowly regenerates over time.[13] Completing these challenges grants the player progress towards increasing their Adventure Rank,
                    which in turn unlocks new quests, challenges, and raises the World Level.[14] The World Level is a measure of how strong the enemies within the world are and the rarity of rewards that defeating them gives.

                    Genshin Impact takes place in the world of Teyvat, and is composed of seven major nations being Mondstadt, Liyue, Inazuma, Sumeru, Fontaine, Natlan, and Snezhnaya.
                    In addition to these nations there is Celestia, a mysterious floating island which is allegedly home to gods and mortals who have ascended to godhood through great, heroic feats.
                    The player character, the Traveler, is separated from their twin and becomes trapped on Teyvat. They are joined by a companion, Paimon, as they journey through Teyvat in search for their lost sibling.
